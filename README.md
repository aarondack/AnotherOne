## Motivation

It seems in this ever changing technology landscape that a new programming language is coming out every second (yes I'm looking at you JVM peeps). This was built as a complete joke, but showcases just how many programming languages there are. Utilizes wikipedia's API, and a big shout out to DJ Khaled providing the theater.
